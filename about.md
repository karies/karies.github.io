<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>PiZero-compatible code</h3>
<p>At home I have a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/">PiZero</a> that needs entertainment.</p>
<ul>
    <li>It's watching our home network devices (WiFi, VOIP / SIP = FritzBox, <a href="https://www.vdr-portal.de/">vdr</a>, fiber internet connection), and reports anything broken as well as incoming calls on its <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-phat-hd?variant=2380803866634">simple LED display</a>: <a href="https://github.com/karies/pistatescrollhd">pistatescrollhd</a></li>
    <li>The Pi Zero is also watching a set of servers I feel responsible for, and tweets when things are down: <a href="https://github.com/karies/pitwibot">pitwibot</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Work</h3>
<p>Most of my fun projects are work-related. Lucky me :-)</p>
<p>You can find my work-identity <a href="https://github.com/Axel-Naumann">here</a>.</p>
