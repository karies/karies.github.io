At home I have a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) that needs entertainment.
It's watching a set of servers I feel responsible for, and tweets when things are down.
I usually know way in advance of any other tool that there's a problem.

You also have a RasPi? Try it for yourself: [pitwibot](https://github.com/karies/pitwibot)
